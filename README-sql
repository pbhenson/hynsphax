hynsphax requires two different databases for operation.

The first one is the central configuration database, which must be available to
all HylaFAX and netsapiens servers. Testing was performed using mariadb; a
sample schema is available in the sql subdirectory in the file
config-mariadb.sql which will create the necessary tables. Any perl DBI
compatible database can be used for this purpose as long as you create
compatible tables using whatever syntax is required. A username/password
providing full access to these tables will be necessary and utilized during the
configuration process. Depending on your database selection, you might also
need to configure necessary access for the various IP addresses of the servers
that are in the deployment.

The second is the local queuing database, which exists separately on each
HylaFAX server. It is recommended to use sqlite for these instances, and a
sample schema named queue-sqlite.sql is available in the sql subdirectory. The
following commands can be used to initialize the queue database on each HylaFAX
server:

	sqlite3 /var/spool/hylafax/config/hynsphax/queue.db < sql/queue-sqlite.sql
	chown hylafax:apache /var/spool/hylafax/config/hynsphax/queue.db
	chmod 660 /var/spool/hylafax/config/hynsphax/queue.db


Again, any DBI compatible database can be used for the local queuing database,
as long as the appropriate tables are created as necessary for your selection.
