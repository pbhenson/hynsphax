x.x   - Add concept of an optional role for servers; assigning a server a role
	allows you to conditionally apply central configuration depending on
	whether the server has a specific role, or does not have a specific
	role

      - Added support for hostgroups in netsapiens and faxback destinations,
        allowing directing a destination to a group of servers rather than
	explicitly listing multiple servers. For upgrades, the new table
	fb_servers will need to be created and the existing tables ns_servers
	and fb_servers will need to be updated.	See sql/config-mariadb.sql for
	details

      - Add + to caller id from value in faxrcvd when number is 1 followed by
        10 digits. Add new hylafax server config variable ns_number_strip_plus
	defaulting to on to remove that + before passing the caller id to
	netsapiens in a phaxio notify

      - Added new source route option for inbound faxes. If a fax is received
        for a number that is not known to the system, the destinations can be
	defined based on the number the fax originated from. For upgrades, the
	table fax will need to be updated. See sql/config-mariadb.sql for
	details


0.7   - Add support for the Faxback ATA Connector software and fax over https
        ATAs

	Added configuration options to control use of SSL for phaxio API
	calls and the ssl option for the netsapiens fax destination to
	override the global default; the default is to enable SSL, be sure
	to verify SSL works properly in your environment if upgrading or
	disable it

        Renamed queue-sqlite.sql sample schema file to hy-queue-sqlite.sql to
	distinguish it from the new fb-queue-mariadb.sql schema file

	Split phaxio specific common code out to separate file making
	existing common code file germane to both phaxio and faxback supportp


0.6   - Fix typo causing queue processing failure if initial callback failed
        and needed to be retried

	Add option to change preview jpeg size

	Generate previews for failed outbound faxes too

	Add option for custom parameters to jpeg preview generation


0.5.1 - Fix 'Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated' warning

        Make preview of only first page for sent faxes


0.5   - First publicly released version
